## Url Patterns
* Home page: /
* Display the sign in page: **/signin**
* Display the sign up page: **/signup**
* Display of search page: **/search**
* Display search results without clicking on sortable column: **/search?direction=&sort=&state_id=&min_price=&max_price=&start_date=&end_date=&pet=Cat&commit=Search**
* Display of sorted search results by a certain order(descending order here) and according to a certain field(min price here) without search filter:       
**preferences?commit=Search&county_id=&direction=asc&end_date=&max_price=&min_price=&pet=&sort=min_price&start_date=&state_id=**
* Display of sorted search results by a certain order(descending order here) ï¼Œaccording to a certain field(min price here) and a certain filter(pet preference here): </br>  **/preferences?direction=desc&sort=min_price&state_id=&county_id=&city_id=&min_price=&max_price=&start_date=&end_date=&pet=Dog&commit=Search**
* Display next page of search results: **/preferences?commit=Search&county_id=&direction=desc&end_date=&max_price=&min_price=&page=2&pet=Dog&sort=min_price&start_date=&state_id=**
* Display of details of one search result: **/preferences/:id**
* Display of specific user's personal information profile page: **/users/:id/edit**
* Log out: /
* Database Admin: /admin
* Users Admin: /underoofadmin (must login with email: admin@underoof.com)
